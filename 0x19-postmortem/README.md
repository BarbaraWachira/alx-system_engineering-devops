**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:** August 12, 2023, 14:30 - August 12, 2023, 16:45 (UTC)
**Impact:** Slow response times and intermittent failures for approximately 25% of users accessing our website's checkout process.

**Root Cause:** A sudden surge in incoming traffic due to a flash sale event triggered a performance degradation in the payment processing microservice.

**Timeline:**

- **14:30:** The issue was detected through a spike in error rates for the payment processing service in our monitoring dashboard.
- **14:35:** Engineers began investigating the issue as automated alerts signaled high response times and error rates.
- **14:40:** Initial assumptions pointed towards a potential database connection bottleneck, and efforts were focused on database queries optimization.
- **15:15:** After optimizing database queries and observing no significant improvement, the investigation shifted towards network-related issues.
- **15:30:** Misleadingly, we believed that a DDoS attack could be underway, leading to firewall rules adjustments to mitigate potential threats.
- **15:45:** Escalation was made to the Network and Infrastructure teams to rule out possible server misconfigurations.
- **16:00:** Further investigation revealed an abnormally high number of open connections in the payment service's internal pool.
- **16:15:** The incident was escalated to the Development team, specifically to the Payment Service sub-team.
- **16:30:** The Development team identified a memory leak issue caused by a mismanaged connection pool, resulting in exhaustion of server resources.
- **16:45:** The memory leak was resolved by correcting the connection pool management code, and the payment service was redeployed.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the issue was a memory leak within the payment service's connection pool management. Connections were not being closed properly after use, leading to a gradual accumulation of open connections and consequent resource exhaustion. This resulted in slow response times and failures for users during high-traffic periods.

The issue was fixed by identifying and correcting the connection pool management code responsible for closing database connections. After this fix, the payment service no longer experienced memory leaks, and open connections were released correctly, restoring normal service performance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- Implement automated tests in the development pipeline to detect memory leaks before deployment.
- Enhance monitoring and alerts for connection pool usage and resource exhaustion.
- Conduct regular performance testing and capacity planning to anticipate potential resource bottlenecks.
- Schedule regular code reviews to identify and address inefficient resource management patterns.
- Implement load balancing and scaling strategies to handle sudden traffic surges without degradation.

**Tasks:**

1. Conduct a comprehensive code review of the connection pool management in the payment service.
2. Develop and implement automated tests to monitor connection pool behavior and identify potential memory leaks.
3. Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities to promptly detect resource exhaustion issues.
4. Introduce automated performance testing to simulate and address scalability concerns.
5. Update documentation to include best practices for connection pool management and resource-efficient coding.

By addressing these tasks, we aim to prevent future occurrences of memory leaks and resource exhaustion issues, ensuring our services remain resilient and performant even during peak traffic events.
